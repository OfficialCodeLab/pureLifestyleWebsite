  <p>PURE lifestyle is a young and dynamic company run by Haydn and Elaine Wright.</p>
  <p>The pair along with their team has a refreshing angle on water purification as well as doing business. Their goal is to assist with healthy lifestyles and develop relationship with clients, not just to sell a water purification product.</p>
  <p>PURE lifestyle specializes in the selling of domestic systems and all water purification equipment for the office and home. They also rent systems out for catering as well as restaurants and retail outlets.</p>
  <p>A PURE lifestyle store, based in the Western Cape, Strand, is open Monday to Friday from 8:30am - 5pm to meet all client needs, including servicing of tanks and purifiers.</p>
  <blockquote>
      <p><em>"We have found a tremendous response to our approach of focusing on relationship with our clients and their lifestyle, through education backed by research and nutritional information. Our name represents what we are, not just what we sell. It's all about adding quality to life."</em>            - Elaine Wright.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Go on, taste what water is meant to taste like. It should be light, fresh and invigorating. You haven't tasted pure water if you have not tasted PURE lifestyle's water purified through reverse osmosis.</p>
