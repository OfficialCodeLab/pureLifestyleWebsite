To meet your needs and requirements, please consider these factors:

### Staff

- What is your staff complement?
- Consider the average volume of water consumed per person (approx 500 ml to 1 litre per day)
- What is the walking distance to the dispensing point/rest area?
- How many floors does your staff occupy?

### Requirement Options

- Purifier only
- Dispenser Unit with Purifier
- Cold Water Dispenser only
